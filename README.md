# Project Conversational Agents Repository

Welcome to the repository for the **Project Conversational Agents** course. This project focuses on developing a conversational agent capable of recommending recipes from a database of nearly 1,000 options. The agent will use **speech** as its primary interaction mode, supported by a **visual interface** for displaying relevant information.

### **Project Goals**
- Understand user preferences and constraints (e.g., ingredients, cooking time, dish type).
- Reason over a large recipe database to provide accurate recommendations.
- Handle diverse conversational styles while maintaining task focus.

Starting from a **Prolog database** and a basic agent template, students will develop core functionalities, systematically test the agent, and refine its performance. Teams are encouraged to add creative features to enhance usability and functionality.
